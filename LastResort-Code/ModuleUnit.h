//---------------------------------MODULE UNIT EXPLANATION-------------------------------------
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//This module takes care of the unit behaviour in the game.
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//The unit has 5 distinct phases
//- Rotating: default state. Unit rotates around the player ship
//- Throwing: if you charge the unit, it will be launched respective to its position with the player ship
//- Following terrain: activated when orange unit collides. Unit follows the terrain
//- Bouncing on terrain: activated when blue unit collides. Unit bounces on terrain
//- Returning: unit returns to the center of the player
//- Positioning: unit positions itself from the center of the player to the rotation it had
//----------------------------------------ROTATION---------------------------------------------
//The unit rotates in 2 different ways:
//- Around the player ship, which changes its position. We'll call this rotation "orbit"
//- Around its own center, which changes where it aims. We'll call this rotation "turn around"
//- It also has an animation simulating a rotation on the sphere part. We'll call this "spin"
//- ORBIT
//  - The unit rotates around the player's ship we point to with playerToFollow.
//  - The unit will always orbit to the opposite direction to where we're going.
//	  For example, if we move to the right it will rotate to the left.
//  - The unit can rotate clock wise or counter clock wise.
//  - It will rotate in the way which it has to travel less distance to get to its target position.
//  - If the distance is the same counter clock wise and clock wise, it will prioritize rotatating counter clock wise.
//- TURN AROUND
//  - The unit has 16 different axis or places where it can aim.
//  - The unit will turn around twice as fast as it orbits around the player ship,
//    which means that if the unit is on the right side of the ship and we move to the right, when it is just above the ship, the unit will already be pointing towards the left.
//- SPIN
//  - The unit has 8 different sprites for each of its axis
//  - We created a struct called "SpinAnimation" which will store the 8 different sprites for the 16 different places where it can aim
//    (basically its the same as the animation class but it allows us to have better control over its animations)
